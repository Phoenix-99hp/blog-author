# Personal Author Site for Blog

This is the site that I can use to write new posts that will be published to my blog site (https://phoenix-99hp.github.io/blog-posts/). After logging in, in addition to authoring new posts, through this site I am able to delete exisiting posts and comments. 

The idea for this project came from The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com).
